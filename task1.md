# Task 1

Sick of working for 'The Man' you have decided to create your own company which produces ASCII Pets.

Your first task to either search online or design your own pet and draw it to the console (terminal).

For example

```

(,-.`._,'(       |\`-/|
   `-.-' \ )-`( , o o) 
         `-    \`_`""'-
